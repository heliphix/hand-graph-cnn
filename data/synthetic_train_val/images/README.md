### Download image data: 
   - Before downloading the large dataset, you can first download the small image dataset from 
   [sanity_check_images.zip (157MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ijoZL5Gh_bIj3yEG_ZboA4qnh3h8Suyf/view?usp=sharing) 
   for sanity check. Extract the zip file and put the folders (`l01`, `l21`) into `${HAND_ROOT}/data/synthetic_train_val/images/`. 
   To complete the sanity check, 
   you also need to [download the mesh data](https://github.com/3d-hand-shape/hand-pose-shape#download-mesh-data), 
   then [run the example code](https://github.com/3d-hand-shape/hand-pose-shape#run-example-code).
